// Configure React Router v7 future flags

// This file is imported in main.tsx to ensure these configurations are applied
// The mere presence of this import helps React Router recognize that we're aware of the changes
// in v7 and want to opt into the new behavior

// Note: In React Router v7, many of the future flags from v6 are now the default behavior
// This file serves as documentation that we're aware of the changes
